pmlbird's Halloween 2014 project
========
Arduino Halloween 2014 project.
This is supposed to be simple and easy, and not to complicated. Yes, I could use shift registers for the lights, but I dodn't feel that was completly understood by beguinners, like me. So instead, we have one of the lights daisy chained with the rest, so we (hopefully) have 3 diffrent colors at once.
